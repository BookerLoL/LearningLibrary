/**
 * A Java implementation of a Van Emde Boas Tree using only direct addressing.
 * Check out other versions if you want better performance.
 * 
 * No dupicates are allowed
 * 
 * Supports ints from 0 to total numbers - 1 allowed. 16 -> 0 - 15 supported
 * 
 * Notes: Could consider implementing with a bit set to reduce memory footprint.
 * To allow more than the integer amount, a possibly extension is simply
 * creating an array / list to support additional number ranges.
